# Pong Game in Python

This project is a simple recreation of the classic Pong game built using Python's `turtle` library. The game simulates a two-player paddle-based table tennis game with the following features:

## Features:
- **Two Paddle Controls**: One paddle is controlled using the "W" (up) and "S" (down) keys for Player 1 (left), while the other paddle is controlled using the arrow keys "Up" and "Down" for Player 2 (right).
- **Ball Movement and Bouncing**: The ball moves continuously across the screen, bouncing off the top and bottom walls. If it hits a paddle, it bounces back in the opposite direction.
- **Score Tracking**: A scoreboard keeps track of points. Each time a player misses the ball, the opposing player earns a point. The game resets the ball to the center after a point is scored.
- **Collision Detection**: The game detects collisions with paddles and walls, providing a realistic simulation of the Pong experience.
